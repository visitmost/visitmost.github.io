This plugin allows to add a watermark on all your images, even the ones already uploaded.

== Description ==

The watermark is placed on your images through a htaccess and php file. This means that your images are actually **not modified**. You can still download them from your FTP, and they will not have any watermark.

It applies the watermark on **new images as well as images already uploaded**. 
By deactivating the plugin, the watermark will be removed on all images.

You have to know that :

* you need to be able to create a htaccess file in your uploads directory.
* you need the GD library.
* you need the Apache module «mod_rewrite» to be activated.
* works only with JPG files (for now).

Available languages :

* English
* Français
* Español

== Installation ==

Note : GD library is needed and being able to create a .htaccess file in uploads directory.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I remove watermark after it was added ? =
YES, you can ! The watermark is applied in a way that doesn't modify your original picture. By deactivating the plugin, the watermark will be removed everywhere.

= I deactivated the watermark plugin but I still see the watermark on my images, what's wrong ? =
It's due to **cache**. Your browser keeps in cache your images. You should **empty your browser cache** and try again to check, it should solve the issue.

= How can I add watermark to pictures that were uploaded before the plugin was installed? =
Once the plugin is activated, the watermark will be applied in all your pictures following the settings you chose previously.

== Upgrade Notice ==

= 0.3 =
Major changes in the way the watermark is applied. The plugin has been rewritten on to PHP Oriented-Object Syntax.

== Changelog ==

= 0.3.1 =
* Fix regular expression when auto width or auto height are set for image sizes. (thanks to Gerhard for tracking this bug).
* If watermark.png already exists on the activation of the plugin, it will not be replaced by an empty watermark.png.

= 0.3 =
* **Major changes: Be carefull if you update!**
* It's possible the plugin will not act the exact same way as before.
* You can choose between different **formats of images** that your WordPress setup uses : thumbnail, medium, large, fullsize + customs sizes defined by your themes.
* The htaccess has been rewritten **massively**. And doesn't act the same way as the previous version. Watermark will be applied differently.
* Error code are now displayed for better support.
* The Plugin is now using **Oriented-Object syntax**. It needs at least PHP 5 to work correctly.
* Previous htaccess will **not be merge** with the htaccess of this plugin. It will be renamed so, if you have any problem deactivating the plugin reactivates the old htaccess file.
* The watermark.png file per default is now generated by php.
* Images with parameters (ie: picture.jpg?key=value&key2=value2) are supported but can generate issues. Dots in parameters are not allowed for security purposes.
* Add conditional tags for GD Library.

= 0.2.6 =
* Add conditional tags for apache module **mod_rewrite** in the htaccess file. So that images don't break anymore
* Minor changes in htaccess.php file. The regular expression has been slightly changed.
* Now accepts images **with parameters**. (ie: picture.jpg?key=value&key2=value2).
* To activate these features, I recommend to click on update in the plugin page.

= 0.2.5 =
* A bug happens while updating from 0.1 to 0.2. The watermark is deleted because of the update. 
This version will fix this **major issue**. 
If you were using version 0.2 or 0.1. Please save your watermark image to be able to re-upload it in the new version. This problem will not happen in the future.
* Added a direct setting button to the plugin which appears in the plugins list.

= 0.2 =
* Do not erase a previous htaccess file in the uploads directory, but merge both content.
* Fix the width setting. e.g : The parameter for 400px width was applyed on 500px width images rather than 400px. 
Now, it is applied correctly.
* New translations in French, Canadian French and Spanish.

= 0.1 =
* Initial release
